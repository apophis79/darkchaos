'Training Heal Mode.

'Once training mission starts, the associated shots will slow flash until you hit them to make them lit solid.
'Any shots that have been completed in previous training will be lit solid.
'Once all are lit solid, the training objective achieved and award collected.
'Award: divert pin remains up the rest of the game
'There is a time limit during training missions (60 seconds). If objective is not achieved in time, then award not given. But progress is saved for next training round.
